This is my first Java project where I aim to make a mobile app for couples called 'Coupling'.
This app aims to help couples feel more appreciated from one another without unintentionally
forgetting about what each other's interests, dislikes, favorites and important dates are.
The app also acts as a cheatsheet for people who forgot about certain things about their partner.
In the future, the app is aimed to be developed into the couples' social media with
profit gained from couple events and products, and possibly from additional couple features, and
 the app would store history of previous couples after the couples are no longer together.
 For now, I want it to be not an online app where they can
see other couples, ads and other people's profile, but just an app for couples to use.

Below it will include details for the future where an online feature is included.

The app uses id as the primary key to login and assigns one person as the partner.
Each person has own profile with profile picture, their partner, couple pictures (if uploaded if not blank),
interests, dislikes, favorites, important dates, emoji to possibly indicate current mood,
short status, and location that is only shared with their partner.

profile picture, id, partner (with link) are shown to public while couple pictures,
interests, dislikes, favorites, important dates, emoji and status can be chosen to be
private or public. location is only shared with their partner and will only have the option of
'home' or 'work' without the exact location by setting certain location as 'home' and 'work'.

required personal info are legal name (option to be shown in profile), email (Primary Key),
birthday (option to be shown in profile), id (will show in profile),
partner's id (when clicked will be directed to the partner's profile),
interests (wanting to try : food, movie, hobby, restaurant, country, gift),
dislikes (food, movie, music, hobby, turn-offs, pet-peeves),
favorite (food, movie, music, event, restaurant, gift)
important dates (anniversary, birthday, custom dates)
emoji (basic emoji next to profile pic. just basic emoji faces no words).

Everything in the app has to be not against any copyright.

Minimum Viable Product :
MVP Features:
- User registration with email (primary key), name, birthday, and partner ID
- Profile with interests, dislikes, favorites, important dates, emoji, and status
- Privacy flags for each field (public/private)
- Location (home/work) shared only with partner
- Simple CLI or desktop UI (Java Swing or JavaFX)
